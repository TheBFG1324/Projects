# Blockchain Projects

## Overview

Through a series of hands-on blockchain projects, I developed decentralized applications (dApps) using **Ethereum smart contracts** and the **Hardhat framework**. These projects provided me with practical experience in blockchain technology, smart contract development, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Key Projects

### 1. Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
- Built a decentralized exchange for Ethereum-based tokens, enabling users to swap and trade tokens directly on-chain.

### 2. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Platform
- Developed a platform to facilitate the launch of new tokens, allowing users to invest in tokens during the initial offering phase.

### 3. Lottery System
- Implemented a simple and transparent lottery system using Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring fairness through decentralized execution.

### 4. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Explored the creation of NFTs through a comprehensive tutorial, gaining an understanding of ERC-721 token standards.

### 5. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
- Designed a DAO to enable community governance, allowing members to vote on proposals and manage shared resources.

## Skills and Tools Gained

- **Blockchain Development**: Smart contract design, testing, and deployment on Ethereum.
- **Frameworks and Tools**: Hardhat, Solidity, Ethers.js.
- **DeFi Applications**: Understanding decentralized exchanges, ICOs, and DAOs.
- **Token Standards**: ERC-20 for fungible tokens, ERC-721 for NFTs.
- **Community Governance**: Structuring and implementing DAOs for collective decision-making.
